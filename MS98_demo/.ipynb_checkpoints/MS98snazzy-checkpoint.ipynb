    "How can one rheology unify lithospheric processes with mantle processes? In 1998, Moresi and Solomatov (1) demonstrated a simple but powerful viscoplastic approximation which allowed dynamic formation of a rigid, strain-localising upper boundary over a classic temperature-dependent viscous mantle. The surprising result was a versatile model that not only replicated Earth-like processes, but also changed the way we look at our sister planet Venus."
